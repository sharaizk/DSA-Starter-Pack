Quick Sort works by making an index a pivot point. We make the first item the pivot. And start comparing the values one by one. If an item is less than pivot then we 
exchange it with the first greater item. Then we exchange the pivot with last smaller item.

Now we have two halves and we sort the halves in same way.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n) + O(log n) = O(n log n)
worst: O(n^2)
