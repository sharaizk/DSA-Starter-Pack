MergeSort: It will take the array and cut it in half & will keep cutting the array in half until it has 1 item in each array. Then it will take two arrays and sort them until
all of the arrays are merged back.

Space Complexity:


With merge you have n number of arrays from one array containing n number of elements.

O(n)

Time Complexity:
With Merge for array of 8 elements you need 3 steps to spread it into 8 arrays of 1 element each.

to merge it back you have to iterate each array. so if you have 8 arrays you need 8 operations.
So,

breaking apart: O(log n)
mergin: O(n)

O(log n) + O(n) = O(n log n)
