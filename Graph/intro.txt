A single value is Vertex (Node). Connection between two Vertexes is an Edge.

Graphs are just like a map. Each edge can be weighted

Both Linkedlist & Trees are kind of graphs.

Ways to store in graph:
Adjacency Matrix:


    A  | B | C | D | E
A   0    1   0   0   1
B   1    0   1   0   0
C   0    1   0   1   0
D   0    0   1   0   1
E   1    0   0   1   0


Adjacency List:
{
    A:["B","E"],
    B:["A","C"],
    C"["B","D"],
    D:["C","E"],
    E:["A","D"]
}


Big O:

With Adjency List we store only vertex and connected vertexes. But with Adjacency Matrix we store non connected vertexes too.

Space Complexity:

List: O(|V| +|E|)
Matrix: 0(|V|^2)
