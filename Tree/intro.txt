A linked list is a type of tree. But a tree's node has two arrow's instead of linked list's node's one arrow

In a Binary Tree -> Each node has two nodes on left and right to one node.

A Full Tree has all of the nodes with two childrens

Perfect Tree has values in each line

Node with no children is a leaf

lookup/insert/remove -> O(log n)
